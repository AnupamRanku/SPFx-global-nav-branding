# Global Navigation and Branding for Modern Site using SharePoint Framework Extensions
During Microsoft Ignite 2017, SharePoint Framework Extensions became GA. It gave us whole new capabilities how we can customize Modern Team sites and Communication sites.

Even though there are lots of PnP examples on SPFx extensions, while presenting at Office 365 Bootcamp, Melbourne and taking a hands-on lab, I realised not many people are aware of the new capabilities that SPFx extensions provide. One of the burning question we often get from clients, if we can have a custom header, footer and global navigation in the modern sites and the answer is YES. 

This code sample is an example where Global Navigation has been derived from Managed Metadata.

## More Background
This code sample has been explained and published as a blog:
